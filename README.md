Felipe Fialho example: 

My name is Hannah Mozer from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2009 and currently I'm Tech Lead at Juntos Somos Mais. I'm passionate about open source projects, so I've created some projects as Front-end BR and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).
